<p>My name is Sean Gilmore. I'm in my final semester as a computer science student. I'm currently 32 years old, though I turn 33 this April 25th.<br>
Currently I work at the Cardinal Cushing Centers residential special needs school as the overnight supervisor, though I hope to find a job in my field<br>
after graduation. Before this class the last time I played with code for web was back on MySpace. One of my favorite television shows is The Simpsons.</p>
